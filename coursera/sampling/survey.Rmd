This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
myxbar <- rep(NA, 1000)
for(i in 1:1000) {
  mysample <- sample(df$age,size = 150)
  myxbar[i] <- mean(mysample)
}
hist(myxbar, binwidth=1)
mean(myxbar);mean(df$age)
sd(myxbar);sd(df$age)/sqrt(150)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
summary(df$austin)
sd(df$austin)
hist(df$austin)
box <- rep(NA, 1000)
for(i in 1:1000){
  samp <- sample(df$austin, size = 10)
  box[i] <- mean(samp)
}
hist(box)
mean(box);sd(box)
```


```{r}
d <- df$name_letters
hist(d)
mean(d);sd(d)

box5n = rep(NA,1000)
box15n = rep(NA,1000)
box25nL = rep(NA,1000)
for(i in 1:1000){
  samp5 <- sample(d,size = 5)
  samp15 <- sample(d,size = 15)
  samp25 <- sample(d, size = 25)
  box5n[i] <- mean(samp5)
  box15n[i] <- mean(samp15)
  box25nL[i] <- mean(samp25)
}
summary(d)
mean(box5n);sd(box5n)
mean(box15n);sd(box15n)
mean(box25n);sd(box25n)
hist(box5n)
hist(box15n)
hist(box25nL)
```
##1b) How many of the first 10 students in the dataset had names longer than 5 letters?
```{r}
length(first_10[first_10$name_letters >5, "name_letters"])

```
##1c) How long is the name of the first student in the dataset who is happy less than 40% of the time?
```{r}
happy_less_than_40 <- df[df$happy < 40, ]
happy_less_than_40[1,"name_letters"]
```



Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
